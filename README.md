# README

* This app was generated with `rails new --skip-test-unit rails_spec_fixture_spike`,
  only changes prior to initial commit were additions to .gitignore from
  https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Rails.gitignore and changing
  this readme to Markdown.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
`rake doc:app`.
